<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inductive Displacement Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Inductive Type</li><li>Mutual Inductive Type</li><li>Eddy Current Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inductive displacement sensors are categorized into three main types based on their operation: self-inductive type, mutual inductive type, and eddy current type. Self-inductive sensors generate an electromagnetic field and detect changes in its own field caused by a target object. Mutual inductive sensors use two coils to detect changes in a target object's magnetic field. Eddy current sensors induce electric currents in conductive materials and measure the resulting electromagnetic field changes. Each type offers unique advantages and is suitable for different applications.</p></p>
