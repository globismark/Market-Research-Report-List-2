<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Optical Fiber Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Deck Armour</li><li>Double Deck Armour</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Submarine Optical Fiber Cable market can be categorized into two main types based on the design of the cable armor: Single Deck Armour and Double Deck Armour. Single Deck Armour cables have a single layer of armor for protection against external forces, making them more cost-effective and easier to install. On the other hand, Double Deck Armour cables have an additional layer of armor for enhanced durability and protection, especially in challenging underwater environments. Both types offer different levels of protection and cost considerations for underwater optical fiber cable installations.</p></p>
