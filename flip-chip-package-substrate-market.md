<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flip-Chip Package Substrate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FCBGA</li><li>FCCSP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flip-Chip Package Substrate Market Types include Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (FCBGA) and Flip-Chip Chip Scale Package (FCCSP). FCBGA is a type of packaging that uses solder balls on the bottom of the chip for connection, providing higher performance and reliability. On the other hand, FCCSP is a smaller form factor package with solder bumps directly on the chip for direct connection to the substrate, making it suitable for high-density applications. Both types offer advantages in terms of performance, reliability, and size.</p></p>
