<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passenger vehicle tyre market is divided into two main types - radial and bias tyres. Radial tyres are constructed with cords that run at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, providing better traction and fuel efficiency. Bias tyres have cords that run at an angle, giving them more flexibility but less stability compared to radial tyres. Radial tyres are preferred for their longevity and performance, while bias tyres are more economical and suitable for certain specific conditions. Both types cater to different needs in the passenger vehicle tyre market.</p></p>
