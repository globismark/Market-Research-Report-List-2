<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Vortex Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Vortex Pump</li><li>Open Vortex Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical vortex pumps are categorized into two types: closed vortex pumps and open vortex pumps. Closed vortex pumps have a sealed impeller that prevents contact between the liquid being pumped and the motor, making them ideal for handling corrosive or hazardous chemicals. Open vortex pumps, on the other hand, have an open impeller design that allows for the pumping of larger solids without clogging. Both types of pumps are commonly used in industries such as chemical processing, water treatment, and wastewater management.</p></p>
