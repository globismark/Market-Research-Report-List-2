<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerant Leak Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halide</li><li>Electronic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigerant leak monitors come in two primary types: Halide and Electronic. Halide leak monitors detect leaks by reacting with the refrigerant to produce a visible color change or signal. Electronic leak monitors use sensors to detect refrigerant concentration levels in the air and provide an alarm when a leak is detected. Both types of leak monitors are important for maintaining a safe and efficient HVAC system, with Halide monitors being easier to visually detect leaks and Electronic monitors providing continuous monitoring capabilities.</p></p>
