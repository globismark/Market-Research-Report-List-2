<p><strong>The Automotive Selective Catalytic Reduction System Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passenger Car</li><li>Commercial Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems are commonly used in both passenger cars and commercial vehicles to reduce harmful emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). These systems work by injecting a urea-based solution into the exhaust system, which reacts with the NOx emissions to convert them into harmless nitrogen and water. As a result, SCR systems help vehicles meet stringent emissions regulations while improving fuel efficiency. The automotive SCR system market has seen significant growth due to increasing environmental concerns and stricter emission standards worldwide.</p></p>
