<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Air Conditioning Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refrigerant Air Conditioners</li><li>Evaporative Air Conditioners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine air conditioning systems can be categorized into two main types: refrigerant air conditioners and evaporative air conditioners. Refrigerant air conditioners use a refrigerant gas to cool the air, making them more effective for larger vessels or those operating in hot climates. Evaporative air conditioners, on the other hand, use water evaporation to cool the air, making them more energy-efficient and suitable for smaller boats or vessels in moderate climates. Both types of systems play an important role in maintaining comfortable temperatures on marine vessels.</p></p>
