<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTP Servers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Clock</li><li>Boundary Clock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTP (Precision Time Protocol) servers come in two main market types: Ordinary Clock and Boundary Clock. Ordinary Clocks serve as regular time servers, distributing accurate timing information to connected devices. Boundary Clocks, on the other hand, act as intermediaries between different network segments, ensuring precise synchronization between them. Ordinary Clocks are commonly used in smaller networks, while Boundary Clocks are preferred in larger, more complex network architectures where timing accuracy is crucial for operations.</p></p>
