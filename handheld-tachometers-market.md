<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Tachometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact</li><li>Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Handheld tachometers are classified into two main types: the non-contact and contact tachometers. </p><p>Non-contact tachometers use techniques like laser or optical sensors to measure the speed of rotating objects without physically touching them. They are ideal for measuring high-speed rotating machinery or delicate objects.</p><p>On the other hand, contact tachometers require direct contact with the rotating object using features like a wheel or a cone. They are suitable for measuring lower speeds or objects that are not easily measured from a distance.</p></p>
