<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Brake Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial Vehicle Brake Caliper Market consists of two main types - Single Piston Caliper and Multi-Piston Caliper. Single Piston Calipers are simpler in design, with only one piston pushing the brake pads against the rotor. On the other hand, Multi-Piston Calipers have multiple pistons on each side of the rotor, providing more even pressure distribution and better braking performance. Single Piston Calipers are commonly used in light-duty commercial vehicles, while Multi-Piston Calipers are preferred for heavy-duty commercial vehicles.</p></p>
