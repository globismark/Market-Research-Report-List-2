<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Casters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swivel Caster</li><li>Rigid Caster</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial casters are classified into two main types - Swivel Casters and Rigid Casters. Swivel casters are mounted on a swivel mechanism, allowing them to rotate 360 degrees, providing greater maneuverability and ease of steering. On the other hand, rigid casters only move back and forth in a straight line, providing stability and support. Swivel casters are commonly used in applications where flexibility and ease of movement are required, while rigid casters are preferred for heavy-duty applications where stability and control are more important.</p></p>
