<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cation Exchange Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Strongly Acidic</li><li>Weak Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cation exchange resins are classified into two main types based on their acidity level: strongly acidic and weak acid. Strongly acidic resins have a high number of sulfonic acid groups, making them very effective in exchanging positively charged ions. On the other hand, weak acid resins have fewer acidic groups and are less efficient in ion exchange. Both types of resins are widely used in industries such as water treatment, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals for various ion exchange applications.</p></p>
