<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel rebars are essential in construction projects, with two main market types being deformed steel and mild steel. Deformed steel rebars have grooves or ridges on their surface, providing better bonding with concrete and higher tensile strength, making them ideal for constructions that require strong reinforcement. On the other hand, mild steel rebars have a smooth surface and are suitable for smaller projects that do not require as much structural integrity. Both types play a crucial role in reinforcing concrete structures and supporting buildings and infrastructure projects.</p></p>
