<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compressed Natural Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Vehicle</li><li>LNG Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles run on gas that is stored at high pressure, typically in a tank mounted in the vehicle. They are more common in light-duty vehicles and have a lower energy density compared to LNG vehicles. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) vehicles use gas that has been cooled to a liquid state for easier storage and transportation. They are more prevalent in heavy-duty vehicles due to the higher energy density of LNG compared to CNG. Both types of vehicles are considered environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles.</p></p>
