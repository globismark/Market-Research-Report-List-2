<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Motor Lamination Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Rolled Non-Oriented (CRNO)</li><li>CRGO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Motor Lamination Market Types - Cold Rolled Non-Oriented (CRNO) and Cold Rolled Grain Oriented (CRGO) are two common types of electrical steel used in motor lamination. CRNO steel is non-oriented and possesses uniform magnetic properties in all directions, making it ideal for applications where the magnetic field changes frequently. On the other hand, CRGO steel is grain-oriented, with its grains aligned in a specific direction to enhance magnetic properties, making it suitable for applications requiring a higher magnetic flux density and efficiency.</p></p>
