<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ESD-Safe Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionic Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ESD-safe plastics are categorized into two types: ionic and non-ionic. Ionic type ESD-safe plastics contain ions that help to dissipate static charges, making them suitable for applications requiring rapid static charge removal. On the other hand, non-ionic type ESD-safe plastics do not contain ions, providing long-term static protection without the risk of contamination from ions. Both types play a crucial role in industries where static electricity can damage sensitive electronic components, ensuring a safe working environment for electronic devices.</p></p>
