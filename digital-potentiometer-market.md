<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Potentiometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Volatile</li><li>Volatile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital potentiometers can be classified into two main types based on their memory characteristics: non-volatile and volatile. Non-volatile digital potentiometers retain their settings even when power is removed, making them ideal for applications where precise resistance values must be maintained. Volatile digital potentiometers, on the other hand, lose their settings once power is removed and require calibration upon power-up. The choice between non-volatile and volatile digital potentiometers depends on the specific requirements of the application in terms of accuracy and power consumption.</p></p>
