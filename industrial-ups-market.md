<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial UPS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Industrial UPS</li><li>AC Industrial UPS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial UPS market can be categorized into two types: DC Industrial UPS and AC Industrial UPS. DC Industrial UPS provides uninterrupted power supply by converting AC to DC power through rectifiers and storing it in batteries for backup in case of power failure. AC Industrial UPS, on the other hand, converts AC power from the main source to DC power, stores it in batteries, and then converts it back to AC power for uninterrupted power supply. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining continuous power supply for industrial applications.</p></p>
