<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small Scale LNG market can be divided into two main types: Liquefaction Terminal and Regasification Terminal. Liquefaction Terminals are facilities where natural gas is cooled to its liquid form for storage and transportation, enabling easier shipment to remote areas. On the other hand, Regasification Terminals are where the LNG is heated back into its gaseous state before being distributed for various uses such as heating, power generation, and transportation. Both terminals play crucial roles in the small scale LNG market by facilitating the liquefaction and regasification processes.</p></p>
